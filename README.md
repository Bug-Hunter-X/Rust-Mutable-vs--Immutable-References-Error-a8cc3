This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when working with mutable and immutable references in Rust. The `bug.rs` file contains code that attempts to modify a value through an immutable reference, resulting in a compile-time error.  The `bugSolution.rs` file shows how to correctly manage references to avoid this issue.
